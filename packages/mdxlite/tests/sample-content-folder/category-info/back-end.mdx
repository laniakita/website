Posts with the Back-End tag usually feature a tool/technology I've used and or had an opinion about, to perform tasks in the back-end logic/data layer e.g. reading/writing/modifying/transacting to databases; ingressing, digesting, and egressing data; communicating, developing, and deploying APIs; etc.
