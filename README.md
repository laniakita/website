# Ahiākea
Taking inspiration from the Laniakea Supercluster ([arXiv:1409.0880 [astro-ph.CO]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0880)) we all reside in, which roughly translates to Immense Heaven (Lani == 'heaven', ākea == 'immense'), I named this monorepo Ahiākea (ahi == 'tuna fish'), which roughly translates to Immense fish, which brought me much amusement for reasons I won't explain.

Aside, this repo currently houses a few things:
  - The laniakita.com website, complete with all the articles I've written for it.
  - an unreleased md/mdx file indexer to SQLite database cli tool that runs on Bun & uses Drizzle ORM. I built it specifically for my website, but I'm in the process of genericizing it so I can publish it to npm, so all you lovely people can use it too!
  -  an eslint config package based on the next.js turbo repo example, with my own modifications to it.
  -  a tsconfig package based on the same example, with my own modifications to it.
  -  and finally a tailwind config package, that was based on the turbo with-tailwind example, but it's been heavily altered to contain a catpuccin theme for tailwind/typography as well as many of the animations I plan to re-use across projects.

Now, as to what else this repo may contain in the future is up for debate. Likely future opensource projects that would be better served in here, rather than in their own separate repos.
