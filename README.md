# Ahiākea
Taking inspiration from the Laniakea Supercluster ([arXiv:1409.0880 [astro-ph.CO]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0880)) we all reside in, which roughly translates to Immense Heaven (Lani == 'heaven', ākea == 'immense'), I named this monorepo Ahiākea (ahi == 'tuna fish'), which roughly translates to Immense fish, which brought me much amusement for reasons I won't explain.

Aside, this repo currently houses a few things:
  - The laniakita.com website source code.
    - Note:
      - While I've made the sites source code available under GPLv3, The written content (blog posts) as well my own artwork (collectively known as Works) are not. My Works shall remain to be my own Intellectual Property, and I will aggressively protect them as such, so help me God.
      - While you're free to browse and take inspiration from the source code of my website, it comes with no warranty and I won't be providing any support for anything you attempt to do with it whatsoever. It's pretty custom to my own needs, and not exactly a generic template to work off of. You'd be better served purchasing a template from [Vercel's template store](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js) if that's what you're looking for.
  - an unreleased md/mdx file indexer to SQLite database cli tool that runs on Bun & uses Drizzle ORM. I built it specifically for the website above, but I'm in the process of genericizing it so I can publish it to npm, so all you lovely people can use it too!
  -  an eslint config package based on the next.js turbo repo example, with my own modifications to it.
  -  a tsconfig package based on the same example, with my own modifications to it.
  -  and finally a tailwind config package, that was based on the turbo with-tailwind example, but it's been heavily altered to contain a catpuccin theme for tailwind/typography as well as many of the animations I plan to re-use across projects.

Now, as to what else this repo may contain in the future is up for debate. Likely future opensource projects that would be better served in here, rather than in their own separate repos.
