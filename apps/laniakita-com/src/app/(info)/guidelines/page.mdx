# Community Guidelines

**Effective April 21st, 2024**

While I don't have comments enabled yet, this will eventually be necessary, and these will be the rules when that happens. When you posts comments, keep this in mind or else you may lose access to this website & other related products permanently.

## 1. Don't be a Dick

The golden rule, ingrain it into your mind. All other rules are extensions of this one rule.

## 2. Don't Hack This Website, or Members on this Website

Unless you plan on providing me a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) disclosure (which if you are, please send that to me ASAP at lani@laniakita.com), you are not to hack this website and or this sites members.

## 3. Don't Harass, Threaten, Stalk, Abuse, or Hurt Anyone.

Jesus Christ this really shouldn't need to be said, but it unfortunately does.

## 4. Don't Post or Link to Illegal Material.

For the love of God, just please don't.

## 5. Don't be a Racist Asshole

Take your hatred against ethnic minorities somewhere else.

## 6. Don't be a Sexist Asshole

Take your hatred against women somewhere else.

## 7. Don't be a Bigoted Asshole
