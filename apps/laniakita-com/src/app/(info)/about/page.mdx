# Full Stack Developer, with a love for the Arts

My name is Lani Akita (she/her) and this site is dedicated to hosting both a selection of my [projects](/projects), as well my [dev blog](/blog).

For the latter, I typically write about the process of developing (mostly web-based) software, but sometimes I'll write about my other interests too, if I'm feeling up to it.

As far as developing web apps go, I'm currently using TypeScript (plus some libraries) when developing backend or frontend applications, which typically coalesce into a single full stack app.

I'm also quite fond of the Arts, even having some formal education into it to boot. Recently I've been painting more with my keyboard in WebGL than I have with a brush, but I'm still fond of the more traditional artistic processes as well. For the latter, I typically work in Krita with a graphics tablet to create 2D digital illustrations.

If you'd like to learn more, you should probably check out the [blog](/blog), and if you find it interesting, you might consider subscribing to the [RSS feed](/rss.xml) or supporting my work by becoming a fan on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/Lani_Akita). You can also check out my socials, linked in the footer below, for the latest updates.
