# Full Stack Developer, with a love for the Arts

My name is Lani Akita (she/her) and this site is dedicated to hosting both the [projects I want to showcase](/projects), as well my [thought blog](/blog). 

The posts I write are typically about the process of developing (web-based) software, but sometimes I'll write about my other interests too.

As for as developing web apps go, I'm currently using TypeScript (plus some libraries) when developing backend or frontend applications, which typically coalesce into a single full stack app.

I'm also quite fond of the Arts, even having some formal education into it to boot. Recently I've been painting more with my keyboard in WebGl than I have with a brush, but I'm still fond of the traditional artistic process as well. For the latter, I typically work in Krita with a graphics tablet to create 2D digital illustrations.

If you'd like to learn more, you should probably check out the blog, and if you find it interesting, you might want to consider subscribing to the RSS feed or supporting my work by becoming a fan on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/Lani_Akita).
