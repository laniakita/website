## TLDR

I ported the [Mandelbulb Daniel Shiffman created in Processing on the Coding Train's YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJCiUVGiNyA) into Three.js. 

## Introduction

I'm somewhat sentimental to this particular Mandelbulb, mostly because **this** was the project that really pushed me to start thinking in terms of Three.js. While yes, the hard work of writing the logic for the bulb was already done thanks to [Daniel Shiffman](https://twitter.com/shiffman)^1, there was still that fact that Processing !== Three.js to deal with. So, there were still some small hurdles for me to clear, which seemed much larger back then.

As well, this particular bulb you're seeing is being rendered with a combination of Three.js + React Three Fiber + React Three Drei, rather than just the pure Three.js functions I wrote back in October of 2023. This is mostly for compatibility reasons with my current site.
