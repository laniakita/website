# Bot Clicker Credits
Big Thank you to all these rad artists who made the following works open-source/royalty free!

## Models

### "[BOT NEIL](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/bot-neil-animation-by-oscar-creativo-56d5d623bb6c40faaa951aca02080510)", by [Oscar Creativo](https://sketchfab.com/oscar_creativo)

License: [CC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

All of the adorable little red robots were created by this amazing artist and you should definitely check out more of their work at the link above!

The ".glb" file that stores the model was compressed with gltfjsx, so you can witness them on a web browser.

Beyond that, there's not actually any hard changes to them. Everything else is done entirely with Three.js sending the math to your device to compute their positional & rotational vectors in time and space, as well as how light and shadow interacts with them.

## Sounds
