# Full Stack Developer, with a love for the Arts

I'm Lani Akita (she/her) and this is where I write my thoughts on the process of developing (mostly web-based) software.

Currently, I'm using TypeScript (plus some libraries) when developing backend or frontend applications, which typically coalesce into a single full stack app.

I'm also quite fond of the Arts, even having some formal education into it. Beyond building stuff for the web, I also like to create art in the 2D Digital medium. I typically use Krita for this, but in the past I've used Procreate.
