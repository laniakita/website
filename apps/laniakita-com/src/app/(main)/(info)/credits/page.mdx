# Credits & Thanks

There's a whole bunch of rad people who I don't know personally, who helped make this whole website even possible by publishing their work to the net as either royalty-free or open-source. So, I wanted to say thanks because I really, really appreciate them for that.

## Models

### "[Blahaj](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/blahaj-ce981de49111488c81ea646067abe1ec)", by [Kaine G](https://sketchfab.com/Kaine_G)

License: [CC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

All of the adorable plush [Blahajs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bl%C3%A5haj) on the landing page were created by this amazing artist and you should definitely check out more of their work at the link above!

**note: I'm not associated whatsoever with Ikea. I just find these plush sharks cute! ^-^**

The ".glb" file that stores the model was compressed with gltfjsx, so you can witness them in all their shork glory on a web browser.

Beyond that, there's not actually any hard changes to them. Everything else is done entirely with Three.js sending the math to your device to compute their positional & rotational vectors in time and space, as well as how light and shadow interacts with them.

## Sounds

### [Pixel UI Sound Effects](https://ateliermagicae.itch.io/pixel-ui-sound-effects) by [Atelier Magicae](https://ateliermagicae.itch.io/)

Thank you to Atelier Magicae! When you click on a Haj there's a 75% chance to hear these really beautiful sounds (specifically "Pixel_54", "Pixel_57", or "Pixel_64" from the pack linked above) created by them. You can find even more of their amazing work at [Atelier Magicae's shopfront on itchi.io](https://ateliermagicae.itch.io/).

### [Baby Squeak Toy 1](https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/baby-squeak-toy-1-183911/) by [floraphonic](https://www.floraphonic.com/)

Thank you to floraphonic! When you click on a Haj there's a 25% chance to hear this adorable squeaky noise! You can find sounds like this and more on [floraphonic's website](https://www.floraphonic.com/).

## Fonts

### [0xProto](https://github.com/0xType/0xProto), by [0xType](https://0xtype.dev/)

License: [OFL 1.1](https://github.com/0xType/0xProto/blob/main/LICENSE)

Thank you to [0xType](https://0xtype.dev/) for creating the incredible 0xProto typeface! It's easily my favorite monospaced font of all time. It's the typeface featured in every code block on this website (as well as all my personal terminals and text editors). I love it, and I really hope you'll give 0xProto a shot too! ^-^

## Libraries

### [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), by [Mr. Doob](https://mrdoob.com/)

Three.js is both an incredible and really convenient library for WebGL, that makes creating 3D experiences (and games like "Haj Clicker" on the landing page) a fairly straight forward process. Thank you to [@mrdoob](https://twitter.com/mrdoob) for gifting the internet something incredible.

### react-three/([fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber), [drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei), [a11y](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-a11y)), [gltfjsx](https://github.com/pmndrs/gltfjsx), [zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand), by [Poimandres](https://pmnd.rs/)

Thank you to the pmndrs collective for all of their hardwork creating these amazing component libraries for Three.js + the react ecosystem!

To create the home page I used the gltfsjsx cli to compress the model I mentioned above & instanced them into typescript components. Then, I used a combination of Three.js + react-three/fiber + react-three/drei + react-three/a11y to make it all come together.

I also took a lot of inspiration from various examples on the react-three/fiber docs site and learned quite a bit in the process. I was also quite pleased to discover zustand as an alternative to redux.

### [catppuccin/tailwindcss](https://github.com/catppuccin/tailwindcss) by [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/)

I'm obsessed with this color palette, I use it everywhere I can. So, naturally, it needed to go on my personal site as well. I tried my best to emulate what a Catppuccin Mauve theme would be like for a website (with my own tastes of course), and this is the end result.

I used the Catppuccin tailwind plugin which included all the color vars I needed to easily and accurately represent this theme, and also I used the Catppuccin @shikijs theme for the syntax highlighting of code blocks in markdown.
