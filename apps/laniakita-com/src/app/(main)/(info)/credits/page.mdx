# Credits & Thanks

There's a whole bunch of people who I don't know personally, who helped make this whole website possible by open-sourcing their work on the internet, and I really, really appreciate them for that.

## Models

### "[Blahaj](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/blahaj-ce981de49111488c81ea646067abe1ec)", by [Kaine G](https://sketchfab.com/Kaine_G)

All of the adorable [Blahajs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bl%C3%A5haj) on the landing page were created by this amazing artist and you should definitely check out more of their work at the link above!

The ".glb" file that stores the model was compressed with gltfjsx, so you can witness them in all their shork glory on a web browser. 

Beyond that, there's not actually any hard changes to them. Everything else is done entirely with Three.js sending the math to your device to compute their positional & rotational vectors in time and space, as well as how light and shadow interacts with them.

## Fonts

0xProto is my favorite monospaced font of all time. Hence, why it's the typeface featured in every code block on this website. While there's many different monospaced fonts out there, 0xProto makes my brain the happiest. This is the font I use in all my terminals and text editors, and I hope you'll give it a shot too! ^-^

## Libraries

### [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), by [Mr. Doob](https://mrdoob.com/)

Without three.js, the web would be a very different place, so I'm very grateful this incredible library for WebGL exists. Really massive thank you to [@mrdoob](https://twitter.com/mrdoob).

### react-three/([fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber), [drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei), [a11y](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-a11y)), [gltfjsx](https://github.com/pmndrs/gltfjsx), [zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand), by [Poimandres](https://pmnd.rs/)

I really want to thank the pmndrs collective for all of their hardwork creating these amazing component libraries for Three.js + the react ecosystem!

To create the home page I used the gltfsjsx cli to compress the model I mentioned above & instanced them into typescript components. Then, I used a combination of react-three/fiber + react-three/drei + react-three/a11y to make it all come together.

I also took a lot of inspiration from various examples on the react-three/fiber docs site, as I mishmashed my way into creating the home page, and learned quite a bit in the process. I was also quite pleased to discover zustand as an alternative to redux.


### [catppuccin/tailwindcss](https://github.com/catppuccin/tailwindcss) by [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/)

I'm obsessed with this color palette, I use it everywhere I can. So, naturally, it needed to go on my personal site as well. I tried my best to emulate what a Catppuccin Mauve theme would be like for a website (with my own tastes of course), and this is the end result.

I used the Catppuccin tailwind plugin which included all the color vars I needed to easily and accurately represent this theme, and also I used the Catppuccin @shikijs theme for the syntax highlighting of code blocks in markdown.
