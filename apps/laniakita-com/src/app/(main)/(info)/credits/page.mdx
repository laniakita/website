# Credits & Thanks

There's a whole bunch of rad people (who I don't know whatsoever) that played a significant part in making this website possible, by publishing their work to the net as either royalty-free or open-source. So, I wanted to say thanks because I really, really appreciate them for that.

## Models

### "[BOT ZUN](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/bot-zun-animation-by-oscar-creativo-c0e0b640363345fa9ac0973d90537978)", by [Oscar Creativo](https://sketchfab.com/oscar_creativo)

License: [CC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

All of the little blue robots on the landing page were created by this amazing artist and you should definitely check out more of their work at the link above!

The ".glb" file that stores the model was compressed with gltfjsx, so you can witness them on a web browser.

Beyond that, there's not actually any hard changes to them. Everything else is done entirely with Three.js sending the math to your device to compute their positional & rotational vectors in time and space, as well as how light and shadow interacts with them.


## Sounds

### [FilmCow Royalty Free Sound Effects Library Vol. 4](https://filmcow.itch.io/filmcow-sfx-4) by [FilmCow](https://www.filmcow.com/)
I grew up watching FilmCow's cartoons, so I was overjoyed to find this royalty-free SFX Library they released. So, massive thank you to FilmCow!!! ^-^ When you click on a Bot, there's a chance you'll hear some of Jason Steele's incredible voice work, which you can find more of at [FilmCow.com](https://filmcow.com).

### [Pixel UI Sound Effects](https://ateliermagicae.itch.io/pixel-ui-sound-effects) by [Atelier Magicae](https://ateliermagicae.itch.io/)

Big thank you to Atelier Magicae! When you click on a Bot there's a chance to hear these really beautiful sounds created by them. You can find even more of their amazing work at [Atelier Magicae's shopfront on itch.io](https://ateliermagicae.itch.io/).

## Fonts

### [0xProto](https://github.com/0xType/0xProto), by [0xType](https://0xtype.dev/)

License: [OFL 1.1](https://github.com/0xType/0xProto/blob/main/LICENSE)

Thank you to [0xType](https://0xtype.dev/) for creating the incredible 0xProto typeface! It's easily my favorite monospaced font of all time. It's the typeface featured in every code block on this website (as well as all my personal terminals and text editors). I love it, and I really hope you'll give 0xProto a shot too! ^-^

## Libraries

### [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), by [Mr. Doob](https://mrdoob.com/)

Three.js is both an incredible and really convenient library for WebGL, that makes creating 3D experiences (and games like "Bot Clicker" on the landing page) a fairly straight forward process. Thank you to [@mrdoob](https://twitter.com/mrdoob)!

### react-three/([fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber), [drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei), [a11y](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-a11y)), [gltfjsx](https://github.com/pmndrs/gltfjsx), [zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand), by [Poimandres](https://pmnd.rs/)

Thank you to the pmndrs collective for all of their hardwork creating these amazing component libraries for Three.js + the react ecosystem!

### [catppuccin/tailwindcss](https://github.com/catppuccin/tailwindcss) by [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/)

I'm obsessed with this color palette, I use it everywhere I can. So, naturally, it needed to go on my personal site as well. I tried my best to emulate what a Catppuccin Mauve theme would be like for a website (with my own tastes of course), and this is the end result.
