I made Bot Clicker somewhat by accident. Originally, I was just trying to make something visually interesting for my landing page. But, one thing led to another, and I wound up creating this "game" that's somewhat in nod to the iconic [Cow Clicker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cow_Clicker), created by Ian Bogost.

While I haven't gone as far as making players earn the "clicks" to click on the bots, I also don't feel like that's the point Bot Clicker is trying to make. As such, it's up to you (yes, only you.) to figure it out.

## Technical Summary

To briefly summarize how Bot Clicker came to be, it was created with a combination of Three.js plus some component libraries from the Poimandres developer collective. The actual robot models were provided by Oscar Creativo, and the sounds were provided by FilmCow (voices) and Atelier Magicae (musical sounds).

Now, as far as technical details go we should probably start at the beginning. When I was conceptualizing Bot Clicker, it was important that bot clicker load quickly (no long loading screens) and have a somewhat high graphical fidelity, whilst maintaining a decent framerate. The latter goal was especially challenging to achieve as I'm stuck using WebGL for the time being, since WebGPU support is only at [57.29%](https://web3dsurvey.com/webgpu) as of May 6th, 2024. As such, it was critical to implement as many optimizations as I could to achieve such a thing.

### Loading Fast
To accomplish the first goal (since Bot Clicker is a web game, after all), it was necessary to compress the robot model from megabytes to mere kilobytes. This was accomplished using gltfjsx, a handy cli tool for running both draco compressions and doing the tedious work of mapping out the transformed model into typed react-three/fiber components.

Because the model is rigged and animated (makes instancing challenging), my best option was implementing a Level of Detail (LOD). This meant compressing the model's textures into three different resolutions: 512x, 256x, and 128x, for respective distances of close, medium, and far. Using the tool above, I was able to compress the 7.7 MiB glTF model into a 393.9 KiB .glb, 228.5 KiB .glb, and a 181.1 KiB .glb.

As I didn't want to make things too data intensive on slower mobile connections, only the latter two textures display on mobile screen sizes. This means 256x model is used for close distances and the 128x model for any distance beyond that. This has the added side effect of increasing framerates, which I'll get to in the next section. 

### Optimizations
Since I am stuck using the WebGL API and I decided it was necessary to use frame eating shaders (Bloom Effect), it was critical to optimize things as best I could. 

As mentioned above, instancing the (animated) model was off the table. This is especially due to the fact that gltfjsx doesn't support it OOTB, and the length of time it would take me to do things manually I felt just wasn't worth the added time and complexity costs (Bot Clicker is just a toy for a landing page after all).

So 

s especially necessary on mobile devices with high-res screens and weak processors (in comparison to the processors onboard most laptops/desktops).
