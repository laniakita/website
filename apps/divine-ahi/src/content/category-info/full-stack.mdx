Posts in this category usually center on frameworks (and some tools) that are capable of "centralizing" some or most of the stack, and or exist at the intersection between Back-End and Front-End, and or might just make my life as a generalist that much easier. 

The reasons above is likely why you'll find posts on frameworks such as Next.Js and SvelteKit, even if their "Back-End" capabilities, are better suited to being a [Back-End for the Front-End](https://samnewman.io/patterns/architectural/bff/) rather than as a total replacement to a dedicated back-end application built in Go with Gin for example.
