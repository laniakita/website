The Front-End, which is often just a Graphical User-Interface ([you know the Guuuiii! That thing thats used to track down murderers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkDD03yeLnU)), is essentially a fancy skin that wraps the bones and brains of a back-end application into one coherent narative.

Posts in this category deal with the above, and tend to heavily feature a front-end technology or technique that I've either explored and or was in the process of understanding and or I was just so enthralled by that I decided to write about it.
