Big Thank you to all these rad artists and creatives who made the following works royalty free!

## Main Site

The works below features most prominently across this site.

### Fonts

### [0xProto](https://github.com/0xType/0xProto), by [0xType](https://0xtype.dev/)

License: [OFL 1.1](https://github.com/0xType/0xProto/blob/main/LICENSE)

Thank you to [0xType](https://0xtype.dev/) for creating the incredible 0xProto typeface! It's easily my favorite monospaced font of all time. It's the typeface featured in every code block on this website (as well as all my personal terminals and text editors). I love it, and I really hope you'll give 0xProto a shot too! ^-^

### Styles

### [catppuccin/tailwindcss](https://github.com/catppuccin/tailwindcss) by [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/)

I'm obsessed with this color palette, I use it everywhere I can. Thank you to the people who made the Catppuccin color-pallette, and also big thank you to the community members who create and maintain all these implementations of it!
