This is the source code for my personal website, made publically available for transparency. **IT IS NOT A TEMPLATE!** While you're free to look through it, please don't try to use it as a template for your own website. It's fairly specialized for my own needs, and you'd be much better off using something generic from [Vercel's template collection](https://vercel.com/templates). 

Therefore, there are no warranties or support services of any kind offered from this software, and I will ignore any requests for them as a result.

## On Licensing

While most of the source code falls under this monorepo's GPLv3 license, much of the written/artistic content does not. Please be advised, that in places where it is stated (e.g. the accompanying LICENSE file in the ./content/blog folder), I've retained the copyrights for things like my blog posts and my own artwork (referred to as Works). As such, you may not redistribute these Works for commercial purposes and or the purpose of claiming them as your own.
