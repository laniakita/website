I created this application first as a SvelteKit based eCommerce (Shopify Storefront) app, then later as a content focused Next.js application (sans the Shopify Storefront integration), realigning with the Client's evolving vision to focus on content. This realignment allowed me to take advantage of Next's suite of Image optimization APIs, metadata tools, and more, along with Tailwind CSS, to deliver a lightning fast, responsive, and aesthetically pleasing, web application.

Furthermore, in aligning with the Client's goals for cost efficiency, I deployed this Next.js application to a serverless architecure built on AWS, defined as IaC with SST+Pulumi, and using the `sst` cli to deploy both the backend resources and the application itself to AWS. Even further, I setup a CI/CD pipeline with a GitHub Action runner, for seamless re-deployments.

To create "The Star" branding, I used Figma to create a vector based image I could export as a Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG).
