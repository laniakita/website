I created a Gatsby JS Frontend, for a Strapi CMS backend, hosted on Heroku, with an attached Postgres database. A Google Cloud Storage Bucket is used for asset hosting. Tailwind CSS was used to create a responsive design, and Gatsby's image optimization APIs were used for blurry image srcsets and lazy loading. Finally, the frontend is deployed via Cloudflare Pages.

To create the Maitais at Sunset branding (favicon, and podcast cover artwork), I used Adobe Illustrator. To create the chromatic aberration on the Maitais drink, I used Adobe After effects to create a composition I could then export as a compressed MP4. It's integrated into the frontend with the HTML5 video API.
