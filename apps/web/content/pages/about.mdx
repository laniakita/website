# About Lani

Hi! My name is Lani Akita (she/her) and I build things for the Internet. This is my website (& PWA) and it's home to some of the things I've [created](/projects), as well as my [blog](/blog).

For the latter, I typically write about the process of developing web-based software, but sometimes I'll write about my other interests too, if I'm feeling up to it.

As far as actually developing web apps go, I'm currently using TypeScript (plus some libraries) when developing backend or frontend applications, which typically coalesce into a single full stack app. As well, for web apps that might need some "je ne sais quoi", I've been using Three.js (WebGL wrapper) with a component library (react-three/fiber) to create digital artworks/experiences, such as the ones on this site.

I'm also quite fond of the Arts, even having some formal education into it to boot. Recently I've been painting more with my keyboard in WebGL than I have with a brush, but I'm still fond of the more traditional artistic processes as well. For the latter, I typically work in Krita with a graphics tablet to create 2D digital illustrations.

If you'd like to learn more, you should probably check out the [blog](/blog), and if you find it interesting, you might consider subscribing to the [RSS/Atom feed](/atom.xml) or supporting it by becoming a fan on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/Lani_Akita).
