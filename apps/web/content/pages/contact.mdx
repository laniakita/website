# Contact Lani

### Got a neat project that you think I should write about? Or maybe you need some help with your next big idea? Or maybe my site's just borked on your device and you think I should know about it?

Whatever the situation may be, I'd be happy to hear what's up. You can get in touch with me by sending an email to [me@laniakita.com](mailto:me@laniakita.com), or messaging [@laniakita.com](https://bsky.app/profile/laniakita.com) on Bluesky or any of my other socials linked in the footer down below.

My life can get quite busy at times, but I'll try my best to get back to you within 48-72 business hours, 7-10 business days at most. If you don't hear back from me after two weeks, try sending your message again, as emails sometimes get lost in my spam folder.

Also, thank you for your interest! Talk soon! ^-^
