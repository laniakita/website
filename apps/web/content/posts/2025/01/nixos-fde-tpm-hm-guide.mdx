**Happy New Year!** Yep, it's _that_ time of year again (cold). So, bundle up near the warmth of your PCs exhaust fans, and bask in the glow of artificial light from it's connected display. Because, dear reader, it's time to start anew! And what better way to achieve that, than with a clean install of NixOS?

Sure, perhaps you vowed this would be the year you'd stop distrohopping[^distrohopper], saving your SSD from near certain doom. But if that's the case, there's a good chance you _might just find_ NixOS to be that final hop you've been looking for ... Well, only one way to find out, right?

## Introduction

After taking the time to setup a fresh install of one of my favorite distros, I felt it was a good idea to post a write up about the somewhat extensive process to install it with Full Disk Encryption (FDE), enabling secure boot, and automatically unlocking the encrypted LUKS device via keys stored on the motherboard's TPM chip.

Now, I should state that I didn't come up with this guide alone. This guide is an more of an amalgamation, based pretty heavily upon a lot of other guides and resource materials out there scattered across the net. As such, I encourage you to check out the reference materials [^full-disk-encryption---nixos-wiki][^installing-nixos-with-flakes-and-lvm-on-luks][^installing-nixos-with-full-disk-encryption][^a-modern-and-secure-desktop-setup---guides][^installation-of-nixos-with-encrypted-root][^how-to-install-nixos-with-full-disk-encryption-fde-using-luks2][^lanzaboote-docs-quick-start][^nixos-manual] I used, linked in the footnotes below.

### What is NixOS?

NixOS is a operating system (OS) based on Nix, a purely functional package management system. Nix (the package manager) treats packages like how values are treated in purely functional programming languages, like Haskell, and stores the resultant packages in the _Nix store_ (`/nix/store`). Such packages are built from _Nix Expressions_, via the functional `Nix` language.[^how-nix-works]

In NixOS specifically, the whole OS is built by the Nix package manager, from a Nix expression that declares the entire system's configuration, typically in a `configuration.nix` file. Because everything is declared in a purely functional manner, a new configuration cannot overwrite previous configurations. This results in reliable, atomic upgrades, (which can be atomically rolled back) and reproducible system configurations.[^how-nix-works]

> #### Non-FHS Compliance Warning
>
> The immediate implications of the _Nix store_ is that Nix, and by extension NixOS, are non Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) compliant. This creates many immediate benefits (listed above), but also some new challenges too, such as running precompiled binaries[^nixos-wiki--packaging-binaries].
>
> While there's workarounds[^nix-ld-a-clean-solution][^nixos-wiki--packaging-binaries] and escape hatches[^nixos-wiki--steam] for the latter, If this guide is how you experience NixOS for the first time, then I should warn you about it's most common pain point, before you sink some time into this project. As such, please consider if non-FHS compliance is a deal breaker for you, before wiping your SSD.

### Who is the guide for?

This guide is for anyone interested in using NixOS[^how-nix-works], in a relatively modern, secure fashion. Additionally, the level of technical knowledge in this guide, assumes some familiarity with Linux systems, at least to the point where one might feel comfortable enough to perform a manual install of Arch Linux according to the Arch Wiki's Installation Guide[^installation-guide-archwiki].

While we won't be installing Arch today, we are going to be making heavy use of the command line and TUI based text editors as we perform a manual install of NixOS. I mention Arch, since many of the steps we'll be performing serve the same purpose, but we'll be performing them in a more _declarative_ sort of manner (as we'll see). If that's something you're up for, then this guide is written for you.

On the other hand, if this is your first exposure to Linux or even Unix based operating systems, let alone NixOS, then I encourage you to consider _skimming_ through this guide, instead. That way, you can at least discover if anything I talk about today seems interesting to you, even if some steps might seem beyond your current comfort level of technical expertise. Because, who knows, you might just find you've been bitten by the 'Nix bug before you know it!

### Goals of this Guide

By the end of this article, my hope is that you’ll be able to:

1. Install NixOS with Full Disk Encryption.
2. Use a `flake.nix` to configure your NixOS system.
3. Install and configure `Lanzaboote` to enable secure boot on your machine.
4. Use `systemd-cryptenroll` to unlock your LUKS devices via your motherboard's TPM chip.
5. Use `home-manager` to configure your shell and `git`/`gh`.

## Part 01: From Zero to NixOS

> **WARNING: Lani Akita and laniakita.com (collectively, "I"), offers this informational article without warranty or support.** You are hereby warned that I bear no responsibility for what happens to your device if you follow any of the suggestions, commands, or steps in this article. I am not responsible for any unintended consequences, damages, losses, or any other unfortunate events as a result of you following this article. **You are required to do your due diligence before running ANY command, suggestion, or step offered in this article.** If you disagree with any of the above, do not read, perform, or follow any of the steps, suggestions, or discussions in this article any further. Thank you.

### Prerequisites

1. A machine with a UEFI motherboard
2. A machine with a TPM2 chip (This is only needed for the "TPM Auto-unlock" part of the guide, which uses `tpm2-tss` to enable `systemd-cryptenroll` to enroll your LUKS keys into the TPM chip.[^systemd-cryptenroll])
3. A bootable USB (4 GB minimum) with the Minimal NixOS ISO[^minimal-iso] loaded onto it

### Booting the installer

1. Repeatedly mash `F2` or `F10` or `DEL` or whichever key let’s you into your system’s UEFI/Bios.
2. Disable secure boot (if enabled).
3. Disable the CSM/Legacy Support (if enabled/applicable).
   1. **WARNING: If this was enabled, any legacy hardware you might have (e.g., a GTX 660 with a VBIOS lacking UEFI support) will immediately become incompatible/stop working (until you re-enable CSM/Legacy Support). If you continue, you acknowledge that you're comfortable with removing/losing any incompatible hardware from your current system.**
4. Move the NixOS USB to the highest boot priority (if applicable)
5. Save your changes, and boot into your NixOS USB.
6. Once you've reached GRUB, feel free to either load the installer from the USB itself, or copy it to the RAM. You can also choose _"no modeset"_ if you're having issues (usually graphical) reaching the installer's `TTY`.

> Note: It’s important that we install NixOS in UEFI mode, as we'll be enabling secure boot in [part 02](#part-02-secure-boot-with-lanzaboote). Most modern motherboards/hardware supports UEFI by default. Still yet, you might want to ensure that the Compatibility Support Module (CSM) is disabled if your motherboard UEFI/BIOS has that option.

### Connect to the Internet

Before we proceed with the installation, it’s probably a good idea to make sure you can access the internet way before making any drastic changes (partitioning, formatting, etc.) that would affect your currently installed OS.

So, plug in an ethernet cable, or follow the steps below to setup WiFi, then try to ping a website: e.g., `ping google.com`. If you can see packets coming back, hit `ctrl+c` to stop the pinging, and you should be okay to continue.

Otherwise, stop here, and start troubleshooting. If you still can’t connect to the internet, it’s possible your network adapter is just too new, and thus isn’t supported by the Linux kernel at this time.

#### WiFi Setup

First, make sure your wireless network adapter is actually enabled. You can see which adapters are available with `ip link`

```sh noLineNumbers
[nixos@nixos:'']$ ip link
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
 link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: enp: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
 link/ether 55:a5:b5:c5:d5:f5 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
3: wlp: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DORMANT group default qlen 1000
 link/ether f5:d5:c5:b5:af:f5 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
```

If your WiFi adapter is _DOWN_ like mine (wlp) just run:

```console noLineNumbers
# ip link set <your-interface> up
```

If that results in an error:

```console noLineNumbers
RTNETLINK answers: Operation not possible due to RF-kill
```

Proceed to [RF-kill Unblocking](#rf-kill-unblocking), otherwise skip to [Getting Connected with `wpa_supplicant`](#getting-connected-with-wpa_supplicant).

##### RF-kill Unblocking

First, run `rfkill` to investigate what interface is blocked.

```sh noLineNumbers
[nixos@nixos:'']$ rfkill
ID TYPE      DEVICE               SOFT      HARD
 0 wlan      ideapad_wlan      blocked unblocked
 1 bluetooth ideapad_bluetooth blocked unblocked
 2 bluetooth hci0              blocked unblocked
 3 wlan      phy0              blocked unblocked
```

In my case, my `wlan` interface is “soft” blocked. So, running `# rfkill unblock wlan` unblocks it.

```sh noLineNumbers
[nixos@nixos:'']$ sudo rfkill unblock wlan
ID TYPE      DEVICE                 SOFT      HARD
 0 wlan      ideapad_wlan      unblocked unblocked
 1 bluetooth ideapad_bluetooth   blocked unblocked
 2 bluetooth hci0                blocked unblocked
 3 wlan      phy0              unblocked unblocked
```

Then running `ip link set wlp up` results in no error.

```sh noLineNumbers
[nixos@nixos:'']$ sudo ip link set wlp up

[nixos@nixos:'']$ _
```

##### Getting Connected with `wpa_supplicant`

With the WiFi adapter actually available, we can now continue (mostly) from the official NixOS manual[^nixos-manual] for getting connected to the internet run:

```console noLineNumbers
# systemctl start wpa_supplicant
```

Then bring up the CLI with: `wpa_cli`. From there, you can scan for networks:

```sh noLineNumbers
> scan
OK
> scan_results
bssid / frequency / signal level / flags / ssid
1a:2b:34:56:70    5555  -53 [WPA2-PSK+SAE-CCMP][WPS][ESS] myhomenetwork
...
```

Then add, set, and enable your network:

```sh noLineNumbers
> add_network
0
> set_network 0 ssid "myhomenetwork"
OK
> set_network 0 psk "mypassword"
OK
> set_network 0 key_mgmt WPA-PSK
OK
> enable_network 0
OK
```

Alternatively for an enterprise network:

```sh noLineNumbers
> add_network
0
> set_network 0 ssid "eduroam"
OK
> set_network 0 identity "myname@example.com"
OK
> set_network 0 password "mypassword"
OK
> set_network 0 key_mgmt WPA-EAP
OK
> enable_network 0
OK
```

If everything went okay after the last command, you’ll something like:

```sh noLineNumbers
...
> enable_network 0
OK
<3>CTRL-EVENT-SCAN-STARTED
<3>CTRL-EVENT-SCAN-RESULTS
<3>SME: Trying to authenticate with 1a:2b:34:56:70 (SSID='myhomenetwork' freq=5555 MHz)
<3>Associated with 1a:2b:34:56:70
<3>CTRL-EVENT-SUBNET-STATUS-UPDATE status=0
<3>WPA: Key negotiation completed with 1a:2b:34:56:70  [PTK=CCMP GTK=CCMP]
<3>CTRL-EVENT-CONNECTED - Connection to 1a:2b:34:56:70 completed [id=0 id_str=]
>
```

Then all you have to do is run `quit` to return to the shell, and we can proceed with the next step.

### Partitioning

> #### WARNING: The following steps will result in DATA LOSS
>
> Please make sure you backed up everything important before proceeding through this section!

Now that we’re absolutely positive we can connect to the internet, we’re going to use `fdisk` to partition the drive we want to install NixOS on. Running the ensuing `fdisk` commands will create both a boot partition and a LVM partition. The LVM partition will hold both a root partition and a swap partition.

We’ll use the `fdisk` CLI to perform the partitioning part of the process. But first, we can also use it to list our disks via `# fdisk -l`, so we can get the exact location of the disk we want to partition.

```sh noLineNumbers
[nixos@nixos:'']$ sudo fdisk -l
Disk /dev/loop0: 1021.89 MiB, 1071525888 bytes, 2092824 sectors

Disk /dev/nvme0n1: 476.94 GiB, 512110190592 bytes, 1000215216 sectors
Disk model: SAMSUNG M2VLB512
Units: sectors of 1 ** 512 = 512 butes
Sector Size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disklabel type: gpt
Disk identifier: 09515620-9D73-11EF-BE8C-0800200C9A66

Device             Start        End   Sectors   Size Type
/dev/nvme0n1p1      2048     206847    204800   100M EFI System
/dev/nvme0n1p2    206848     239615     32768    16M Microsoft reserved
/dev/nvme0n1p3    239616  998639615 998400000 476.1G Microsoft basic data
/dev/nvme0n1p4 998639616 1000212479   1572864   768M Windows recovery environment

...
```

Once we've found our disk, we'll pass it's location as an input into `fdisk` to perform the actual partitioning steps:

```console noLineNumbers
# fdisk /dev/your-disk-to-partition
```

In my case the command looks like: `# fdisk /dev/nvme0n1`.

> Many of the commands featured in this guide refer to `/dev/nvme0n1` as an **example**. However, You might have _your_ drive to partition on `/dev/sda` for instance. So, to avoid any unnecessary heartache, please make sure the commands you're running are on the drive you actually want to partition.

#### Create a Empty GPT Table

To begin, we’ll clean up any old partitions by creating a empty GPT partition table (`g`):

```sh noLineNumbers
Command (m for help): g
Created a new GPT disklabel (GUID: 5213d2a2-a040-44c4-ba6a-02787812777e).

Command (m for help):
```

To verify this, you can print (`p`) out the new partition table, which should now be empty:

```sh noLineNumbers
Command (m for help): p
Disk /dev/nvme0n1: 476.94 GiB, 512110190592 bytes, 1000215216 sectors
Disk model: SAMSUNG M2VLB512
Units: sectors of 1 ** 512 = 512 butes
Sector Size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disklabel type: gpt
Disk identifier: 5213d2a2-a040-44c4-ba6a-02787812777e

Command (m for help):
```

> Note: Creating an empty partition table doesn't securely erase the data on your disk. If that's something you'd like to perform, perhaps ATA Security Erase[^secure-erase] might be something worth looking into.

#### Create the EFI System Partition (ESP)

We can then create the ESP like so:

1. `n`
2. (partition number; default) `enter`
3. (first sector: default) `enter`
4. (last sector) `+1G`
5. (remove signature if applicable) `Y`
6. `t` (change partition type)
7. (partition type or alias) `1` (EFI)

```sh noLineNumbers
Command (m for help): n
First sector (2048-1000214527), default 2048):
Last sector, +sectors or +size{K,M,G,T,P} (2048-1000214527, default 1000215216): +1G

Created a new partition 1 of type 'Linux filesystem' and of size 1 GiB.

Command (m for help): t
Partition type or alias (type L to list all): 1
Changed type of partition 'Linux filesystem' to 'EFI'.

Command (m for help):
```

#### Create the LVM Partition

Next, we’ll add our LVM partition:

1. `n`
2. (partition number: default) `enter`
3. (first sector: default) `enter`
4. (last sector: default) `enter`
5. (remove signature if applicable) `Y`
6. `t` (change partition type)
7. (partition number: (1, 2, default 2)) `enter`
8. (partition type or alias:) `44` (Linux LVM)

```sh noLineNumbers
Command (m for help): n
Partition number (1, 2, default 2):
First sector (2099200-1000214527), default 2099200):
Last sector, +sectors or +size{K,M,G,T,P} (2048-1000215216, default 1000215216):

Created a new partition 2 of type 'Linux filesystem' and of size 475.9 GiB.

Command (m for help): t
Partition number (1, 2, default 2):
Partition type or alias (type L to list all): 44
Changed type of partition 'Linux filesystem' to 'Linux LVM'.

Command (m for help):
```

#### Verifying the Partitions

If you print (`p`) out the partition table again, it'll probably look similar to this:

```sh noLineNumbers
Command (m for help): p
Disk /dev/nvme0n1: 476.94 GiB, 512110190592 bytes, 1000215216 sectors
Disk model: SAMSUNG M2VLB512
Units: sectors of 1 ** 512 = 512 butes
Sector Size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disklabel type: gpt
Disk identifier: 5213d2a2-a040-44c4-ba6a-02787812777e

Device           Start        End   Sectors   Size Type
/dev/nvme0n1p1    2048    2099199   2097152     1G EFI System
/dev/nvme0n1p2 2099200 1000214527 998115328 475.9G Linux LVM

Command (m for help):
```

if it looks right, then we can save (`w`) our changes and exit!

Now, running `# lsblk` should look something like this:

```sh noLineNumbers
[nixos@nixos:'']$ sudo lsblk
NAME        MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE  RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
...
nvme0n1      259:0    0  476.9G  0 disk
|-nvme0n1p1 259:3    0      1G  0 part
|-nvme0n1p2 259:4    0  475.9G  0 part

[nixos@nixos:'']$
```

### Encrypting with LUKS

We’ll be encrypting the LVM partition with LUKS (version 2). To do that, we just have to run the following command:

```console noLineNumbers
# cryptsetup -v -y --label=NIXLUKS luksFormat --type luks2 /dev/nvme0n1p2
```

The `-v` flag ensures a verbose output, `-y` ensures it’ll ask us for our encryption password twice to confirm, the label flag is simply assigned to `NIXLUKS` but you can call it whatever you want. `luksFormat` actually encrypts our disk, and the `--type` flag set to `luks2`.[^cryptsetup] This is important because it's both newer, and a necessary requirement to use `systemd-cryptenroll`, which enables enrolling your LUKS keys into the TPM2.[^systemd-cryptenroll]

```sh noLineNumbers
[nixos@nixos:'']$ sudo cryptsetup -v -y --label=NIXLUKS luksFormat --type luks2 /dev/nvme0n1p2

WARNING!
========
This will overwrite data on /dev/nvme0n1p2 irrevocably.

Are you sure? (Type 'yes' in capital letters): YES
Enter passphrase fpr /dev/nvme0n1p2:
verify passphrase:
Key slot 0 created.
Command successful.

[nixos@nixos:'']$
```

#### Verifying the LUKS Device

To verify the partition got encrypted, you can inspect the LUKS header using:

```console noLineNumbers
# cryptsetup luksDump /dev/nvme0n1p2
```

Which will give an output similar to this:

```sh noLineNumbers
[nixos@nixos:'']$ sudo cryptsetup luksDump /dev/nvme0n1p2
LUKS header information
Version         2
...
UUID:           09515620-9D73-11EF-BE8C-0800200C9A66
label:          NIXLUKS
...
```

The most important thing to note is the version number and your label. If it’s “2”, and your label looks right, then we’re all good to go.

> As a best practice, you may want to backup the header sometime later. You can do so with the following command:
>
> ```console noLineNumbers
> # cryptsetup luksHeaderBackup /dev/nvme0n1p2 --header-backup-file /path/to/backup.dat
> ```

#### Opening the LUKS Device

Now, we’re going to open our encrypted LUKS partition and create a reference to it on `/dev/mapper/cryptroot` with:

```console noLineNumbers
# cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/nvme0n1p2 cryptroot
```

You can then check our mapped partition exists with: `ls /dev/mapper/cryptroot`

This won't return anything really (because there's nothing in `cryptroot` yet), unless `cryptroot` doesn't exist.

```sh noLineNumbers
[nixos@nixos:'']$ ls /dev/mapper/cryptroot
/dev/mapper/cryptroot

[nixos@nixos:'']$
```

### LVM Partitioning

Before creating the root and swap (and other possible) logical volumes (LVs), we'll first need to create a Physical Volume on `cryptroot`, which can then be used to create a Logical Volume Group (LVG) named `lvmroot`.

```console noLineNumbers
# pvcreate /dev/mapper/cryptroot
```

```console noLineNumbers
# vgcreate lvmroot /dev/mapper/cryptroot
```

With that, we can create the _root_ LV and the _swap_ LV. You can of course create as many LVs as you want, such as a _home_ LV. However, for my purposes, I’m going to keep it simple.

#### Create the `swap` Logical Volume

We can create the swap LV on our root LVG (lvmroot) with the following command:

```console noLineNumbers
# lvcreate -L24G lvmroot -n swap
```

> Note: How much swap space you may need varies. You might not even need it! So, please see the linked ~~stackoverflow~~ [askubuntu thread](https://askubuntu.com/questions/49109/i-have-16gb-ram-do-i-need-32gb-swap)[^i-have-16gb-ram--do-i-need-32gb-swap] for more. In my case, I’ve got 16 GB of ram on the laptop I'm using as the example for this guide, and plan to use hibernate, so 16 \* 1.5 = 24 GB.

#### Create the `root` Logical Volume

With the swap LV set, we can set the root LV to take up the rest of the available space:

```console noLineNumbers
# lvcreate -l 100%FREE lvmroot -n root
```

### Formatting

This is a fairly standard procedure, the only thing of note here is adding labels, which makes mounting the partitions much easier.

> YSK: The volume label string for the bootable, ESP partition (FAT32) has a maximum length of only 11 bytes[^fat-osdev-wiki]. Both the ext4 and Swap partitions have a maximum volume label length of 16 bytes. [^ext4-spec-global-structures-superblock-linux-kernel][^man-swaplabel].

1. Format the ESP partition:

   ```console noLineNumbers
   # mkfs.fat -F 32 -n NIXBOOT /dev/nvme0n1p1
   ```

2. Format the Root LV:

   ```console noLineNumbers
   # mkfs.ext4 -L NIXROOT /dev/mapper/lvmroot-root
   ```

3. Format the Swap LV (if you made one):

   ```console noLineNumbers
   # mkswap -L NIXSWAP /dev/mapper/lvmroot-swap
   ```

### Mounting

Then we can mount the formatted partitions like so.

1. Mount the Root LV:

   ```console noLineNumbers
   # mount /dev/disk/by-label/NIXROOT /mnt
   ```

2. Create the ESP Directory:

   ```console noLineNumbers
   # mkdir /mnt/boot
   ```

3. Mount the ESP:

   ```console noLineNumbers
   # mount -o umask=0077 /dev/disk/by-label/NIXBOOT /mnt/boot
   ```

4. Turn on Swap:

   ```console noLineNumbers
   # swapon -L NIXSWAP
   ```

#### Verifying the Mounts

To verify everything is in the right place, running:

```console noLineNumbers
# lsblk -o name,label,size,type,mountpoints /dev/nvme0n1
```

should result in output similar to this:

```sh noLineNumbers
[nixos@nixos:'']$ sudo lsblk -o name,label,size,type,mountpoints /dev/nvme0n1
NAME                LABEL     SIZE TYPE  MOUNTPOINTS
nvme0n1                     476.9G disk
|-nvme0n1p1         NIXBOOT     1G part  /mnt/boot
|-nvme0n1p2         NIXLUKS 475.9G part
   |-cryptroot              475.9G crypt
     |-lvmroot-swap NIXSWAP    24G lvm   [SWAP]
     |-lvmroot-root NIXROOT 451.9G lvm   /mnt

[nixos@nixos:'']$
```

### Installing NixOS

We’ll first generate a minimal configuration file. Then we’ll edit it to support our LUKS encrypted partitions.

```console noLineNumbers
# nixos-generate-config --root /mnt
```

then we can use Vim (or nano) prefixed with `sudo` to edit our generated config to mount our LUKS partition. If you forget to elevate your editor command, you won't be able to save your changes—_don't ask me how I know that._

```console noLineNumbers
# vim /mnt/etc/nixos/hardware-configuration
```

#### `hardware-configuration.nix`

Our generated config currently looks something like this:

```nix
# Do not modify this file! It was generated by ■nixos-generate-config■
# and may be overwritten by future invocations. Please make changes
# to /etc/nixos/configuration.nix instead.
{ config, lib, pkgs, modulesPath, ... }:

{
  imports =
    [ (modulesPath + "/installer/scan/not-detected.nix")
    ];

  boot.initrd.availableKernerlModules = ["xhci_pci" "ahci" "nvme" "usb_storage" "usbhid" "sd_mod" ];
  boot.initrd.kernelModules = [ "dm-snapshot" ];
  boot.kernelModules = [ "kvm-intel" ];
  boot.extraModulePackages = [ ];

  fileSystems."/" =
    {
      device = "/dev/disk/by-uuid/f96d7825-6b61-452b-a6f9-456ad8ba308f";
      fsType = "ext4";
    };

  fileSystems."/boot" =
    {
      device = "/dev/disk/by-uuid/6335-2377";
      fsType = "vfat";
      options = [ "fmask=0077" "dmask=0077" ];
    };

  swapDevices =
    [{ device = "/dev/disk/by-uuid/b0849f28-36bf-41c1-b58f-108f4a51442a"; }
    ];

  # Enables DHCP on each ethernet and wireless interface. In case of scripted networking
  # (the default) this is the recommended approach. When using systemd-networkd it's
  # still possible to use this option, but it's recommended to use it in conjunction
  # with explicit per-interface declaration with `networking.interfaces.<interface>.useDHCP`.
  networking.useDHCP = lib.mkDefault true;

  nixpkgs.hostPlatform = lib.mkDefault = "x86_64-linux";
  hardware.cpu.intel.updatedMicrocode = lib.mkDefault config.hardware.enableRedistributableFirmware;
}
```

While it's nearly perfect, it doesn't take into account our LUKS device, and so we'll have to disregard the ominous warnings to make some minor changes if we want our machine to be useable. In short, all we have to do is:

- Add `cryptd` to `boot.initrd.kernelModules`.
- Define our LUKS partition as a LUKS device under `boot.initrd.luks.devices."cryptroot"`.
- Update our filesystem mounts to use “by-label” for ease of use / readability.

This last change is optional, but I find it helpful for compatibility reasons:

- Set `hardware.enableAllFirmware` to `true`.

```nix {12,13,14,18,21,27,33,43}
# Do not modify this file! It was generated by ■nixos-generate-config■
# and may be overwritten by future invocations. Please make changes
# to /etc/nixos/configuration.nix instead.
{config, lib, pkgs, modulesPath, ...}:

{
  imports =
    [ (modulesPath + "/installer/scan/not-detected.nix")
    ];

  boot.initrd.availableKernerlModules = ["xhci_pci" "ahci" "nvme" "usb_storage" "usbhid" "sd_mod" ];
  boot.initrd.kernelModules = [ "dm-snapshot" "cryptd" ]; # add cryptd
  # Define our LUKS device
  boot.initrd.luks.devices."cryptroot".device = "/dev/disk/by-label/NIXLUKS";
  boot.kernelModules = [ "kvm-intel" ];
  boot.extraModulePackages = [ ];

  # Use labels instead of UUIDs to mount our LVs
  fileSystems."/" =
    {
      device = "/dev/disk/by-label/NIXROOT";
      fsType = "ext4";
    };

  fileSystems."/boot" =
    {
      device = "/dev/disk/by-label/NIXBOOT";
      fsType = "vfat";
      options = [ "fmask=0077" "dmask=0077" ];
    };

  swapDevices =
    [{ device = "/dev/disk/by-label/NIXSWAP"; }
    ];

  # Enables DHCP on each ethernet and wireless interface. In case of scripted networking
  # (the default) this is the recommended approach. When using systemd-networkd it's
  # still possible to use this option, but it's recommended to use it in conjunction
  # with explicit per-interface declaration with `networking.interfaces.<interface>.useDHCP`.
  networking.useDHCP = lib.mkDefault true;

  nixpkgs.hostPlatform = lib.mkDefault = "x86_64-linux";
  hardware.enableAllFirmware = true; # Helps with compatibility
  hardware.cpu.intel.updatedMicrocode = lib.mkDefault config.hardware.enableRedistributableFirmware;
}
```

With our edits in place, we can save and exit the `hardware-configuration.nix` file and move on to `configuration.nix`.

> ##### Thoughts on the _ominous warnings_
>
> In all likelihood, this is the only time you'll ever run `nixos-generate-config`, so feel free to make edits to `hardware-configuration.nix`. Just be aware that running `nixos-generate-config` again, will undo all the changes you've made to it.

#### `configuration.nix`

`configuration.nix` is where you'll want to configure everything else about your machine (e.g., hostname, user accounts, networking, window managers, programs, etc.). As such, we'll want to make some edits from the minimal configuration to something a lot more useable. Because, as it stands, the generated `configuration.nix` has most of what we need commented out:

```nix
# Edit this configuration file to define what should be installed on
# your system. Help is available in the configuration.nix(5) man page, on
# https://search.nixos.org/options and in the NixOS manual (`nixos-help`).

{ config, lib, pkgs, ... }:

{
  imports =
    [ # Include the results of the hardware scan.
      ./hardware-configuration.nix
    ];

  # Use the systemd-boot EFI boot loader.
  boot.loader.systemd-boot.enable = true;
  boot.loader.efi.canTouchEfiVariables = true;

  # networking.hostName = "nixos"; # Define your hostname.
  # Pick only one of the below networking options.
  # networking.wireless.enable = true; # Enables wireless support via wpa_supplicant
  # networking.networkManager.enable = true; # Easiest to use and most distros use this by default.

  # Set your time zone.
  # time.timeZone = "America/New_York";

  # Configure network proxy if necessary
  # networking.proxy.default = "http://user:password@proxy:port/";
  # networking.proxy.noProxy = "127.0.0.1,localhost,internal.domain";

  # Select internationalisation properties.

  # Open ports in the firewall.
  # networking.firewall.allowedTCPPorts = [ ... ];
  # networking.firewall.allowedUDPPorts = [ ... ];
  # Or disable the firewall altogether.
  # networking.firewall.enable = false;

  # Copy the NixOS configuration file and link it from the resulting system
  # (/run/current-system/configuration.nix). This is useful in cage you
  # accidentally delete configuration.nix.
  # system.copySystemConfiguration = true;

  # The option defines the first version of NixOS you have installed on this particular machine.

  # even if you've upgraded your system to a new NixOS release.
  #
  # This value does NOT affect the Nixpkgs version your pacakges and OS are pulled from,
  # so changing it will NOT upgrade your system - see https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/#sec-upgrading for how to actually do that.
  #
  # This value being lower than the current NixOS release does NOT mean your system is
  # out of date, out of support, or vulnerable.
  #
  # Do NOT change this value unless you have manually inspected all the changes it would make to your configuration,
  # and migrated your data accordingly.
  #
  $ For more information, see `man configuration.nix` or https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/options#opt-system.stateVersion .
  system.stateVersion = "24.05"; # Did you read the comment?
}
```

To make our changes, we can use `vim` or `nano` again to load `configuration.nix` into an editing buffer:

```console noLineNumbers
# vim /mnt/etc/nixos/configuration.nix
```

From there we'll, uncomment out network manager, we'll enable flakes, we'll update our time zone, add an account, and anything else we might need.

##### Core configuration

The following configures/enables what I believe to be the most important features/options. You'll be able to enable most of them simply by uncommenting them out (removing the `#` before them) and or modifying their default values.

###### Add a hostname

```nix
networking.hostName = "my-nixos-machine"; # Define your hostname.
```

Your hostname will correlate with the host system defined in your `nixosConfiguration`. If you plan on sharing a single `flake.nix` between multiple NixOS machines, it's probably for the best you change this to something unique—well, unique amongst the machine's that have differing configurations.

###### Enable network manager

```nix
networking.networkManager.enable = true;
```

Network Manager is both the easiest and (unsurprisingly) the default networking tool for most Distros. It's also what I prefer using, but you might prefer `wpa_supplicant` instead.

###### Enable flakes

```nix
nix.settings.experimental-features = [“nix-command” “flakes”];
```

Flakes are one of my most favorite things about Nix. They're incredibly versatile from setting up [modular, multi-machine configurations from a single `flake.nix`](https://nixos-and-flakes.thiscute.world/nixos-with-flakes/modularize-the-configuration#modularize-your-nixos-configuration)[^modularize-your-nixos-configuration] to creating reproducible [development environments](https://github.com/the-nix-way/dev-templates)[^the-nix-way-dev-templates]. In short, they're quite handy.

###### Update the time zone

```nix
time.timeZone = “America/Los_Angeles”
```

I believe it's also possible to update your time zone imperatively as well, if you're Desktop Environment (i.e., Gnome, Plasma, etc.) allows it. As such, setting it from `configuration.nix` will thus establish it as the "default" global/system time zone.

###### Add a user account with `superuser` privileges, that's also in the _`networkmanager`_ group

```nix
users.users.mycoolusername = {
  isNormalUser = true;
  extraGroups = [“wheel” “networkmanager”];
};
```

`superuser` privileges via the "wheel" group, gives your user (in this case a user named `mycoolusername`) access to `sudo`. If you tried to use `sudo` without being in the `wheel` group or being given explicit access somewhere in the `sudoers` file, well [it becomes an "incident", and gets reported ... somewhere](https://xkcd.com/838/)[^incident-xkcd].

Adding your user to the `networkmanager` group, while possibly optional, helps to ensure your user has the right permissions to use/configure `networkmanager`.

> If you're wondering about the user password, that's something we'll configure at the very end, just before rebooting.

###### Enable unfree packages (optional)

```nix
nixpkgs.config.allowUnfree = true;
```

Allowing "unfree" packages, will give you access to closed-source/proprietary binaries/software, such as Nvidia's proprietary Linux drivers. It's really up to you whether you want to enable this feature or not.

###### Helpful Packages/Software

```nix
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
  vim # Do not forget to add an editor to edit configuration.nix! The Nano editor is also installed by default.
  wget
  firefox
  chromium # swap for ungoogled-chromium if you prefer
];
```

At minimum, you'll want to add a secondary terminal based editor like `vim`, and a browser like `firefox` or alternatively, `chromium` and or `ungoogled-chromium`.

##### Anything Else You Might Want

Beyond the [Core configuration](#core-configuration) above, I'll leave it up to you to determine how you want to configure the rest of your machine. For example, you'll probably want to choose a Desktop Environment (DE) or alternatively, configure a Window Manager (WM). I'll leave the following suggestions to give you some ideas:

###### Add a Desktop Environment or, alternatively, a Window Manager

In 2024, the two most popular DEs remain to be Gnome and Plasma. You can enable Gnome like this (see: [wiki.nixos.org/wiki/GNOME](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/GNOME)[^nixos-wiki--gnome]):

```nix
services.xserver.enable = true;
services.xserver.displayManager.gdm.enable = true;
services.xserver.desktopManager.gnome.enable = true;
```

Or KDE Plasma like this (see: [wiki.nixos.org/wiki/KDE](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/KDE)[^nixos-wiki--kde])

```nix
services.xserver.enable = true; # optional
services.displayManager.sddm.enable = true;
services.displayManager.sddm.wayland.enable = true;
services.desktopManager.plasma6.enable = true;
```

Alternatively you can configure a Window Manager, such as Sway, like this (see: [wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Sway](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Sway)[^nixos-wiki--sway])

```nix
# A very minimal Sway configuration
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
  grim # screenshot functionality
  slurp # screenshot functionality
  wl-clipboard # wl-copy and wl-paste for copy/paste from stdin / stdout
  mako # notification system developed by swaywm maintainer
];

# Enable the gnome-keyring secrets vault.
# Will be exposed through DBus to programs willing to store secrets.
services.gnome.gnome-keyring.enable = true;

# enable sway window manager
programs.sway = {
  enable = true;
  wrapperFeatures.gtk = true;
};

services.xserver = {
  displayManager.gdm = {
    enable = true;
    wayland = true;
  };
};
```

> The nice thing about NixOS is that you're not stuck with a DE or WM. If you want to try something else, just edit your config to accomodate whichever thing you want, run `# nixos-rebuild switch` and you'll have a totally new desktop experience!

###### Enable PipeWire (sound)

```nix
# rtkit is optional but recommended
security.rtkit.enable = true;
services.pipewire = {
  enable = true; # if not already enabled
  alsa.enable = true;
  alsa.support32Bit = true;
  pulse.enable = true;
  # If you want to use JACK applications, uncomment this
  #jack.enable = true;
};
```

PipeWire is a modern replacement for Pulse Audio, and if you're using Ardour or some other DAW, you'll want to enable JACK as well (see: [wiki.nixos.org/wiki/PipeWire](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/PipeWire)[^nixos-wiki--pipewire]). For configuring Bluetooth audio you'll want to see: [wiki.nixos.org/wiki/PipeWire#Bluetooth_Configuration](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/PipeWire#Bluetooth_Configuration)[^nixos-wiki--pipewire-bt].

###### Enable Bluetooth

```nix
hardware.bluetooth.enable = true; # enables support for Bluetooth
hardware.bluetooth.powerOnBoot = true; # powers up the default Bluetooth controller on boot
```

The above should enable Bluetooth, and if your DE doesn't come with a Bluetooth manager GUI, you can additionally enable the `blueman` applet

```nix
services.blueman.enable = true;
```

For more see: [wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Bluetooth](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Bluetooth)[^nixos-wiki--bluetooth].

###### Enable CUPS + Avahi

```nix
# Enable CUPS to print documents.
services.printing.enable = true;
services.avahi = {
  enable = true;
  nssmdns4 = true;
  openFirewall = true;
};
```

Enabling CUPS will allow you to print things. Enabling Avahi will allow you to find printers on your network. For more see: [wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Printing](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Printing)[^nixos-wiki--printing].

###### Use an Alternative Shell (e.g., `zsh`)

```nix
programs.zsh.enable = true;
users.defaultUserShell = pkgs.zsh;
```

If you've been hacking away at the command line on a Mac in the last decade, chances are you've become attached to using `zsh` instead of `bash`. In that case, the above will change the default shell (`bash`) to something that feels much more at home (`zsh`). For more see: [wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Zsh](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Zsh)[^nixos-wiki--zsh].

Alternatively, you can use [`fish`](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Fish)[^nixos-wiki--fish] or even [`nushell`](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Nushell)[^nixos-wiki--nushell].

> As for custom prompts like [starship](https://starship.rs/)[^starship--cross--shell-prompt] and plugins like [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)[^zsh-users-zsh-syntax-highlighting], we'll be using Home-Manager via the `flake.nix` in this guide to configure that.

##### Example `configuration.nix`

```nix
{ config, lib, pkgs, ... }:

{
  imports =
    [ # Include the results of the hardware scan.
      ./hardware-configuration.nix
    ];

  # Use the systemd-boot EFI boot loader.
  boot.loader.systemd-boot.enable = true;
  boot.loader.efi.canTouchEfiVariables = true;

  networking.hostName = "nixos"; # Define your hostname.
  networking.networkManager.enable = true; # Easiest to use and most distros use this by default.

  # Set your time zone.
  time.timeZone = "America/Los_Angeles";

  # Enable Flakes
  nix.settings.experimental-features = [“nix-command” “flakes”];

  # Enable the Gnome Desktop Environment
  services.xserver.enable = true;
  services.xserver.displayManager.gdm.enable = true;
  services.xserver.desktopManager.gnome.enable = true;

  # Enable CUPS to print documents.
  services.printing.enable = true;
  services.avahi = {
    enable = true;
    nssmdns4 = true;
    openFirewall = true;
  };

  # Enable sound.
  security.rtkit.enable = true;
  services.pipewire = {
    enable = true; # if not already enabled
    alsa.enable = true;
    alsa.support32Bit = true;
    pulse.enable = true;
    # If you want to use JACK applications, uncomment this
    #jack.enable = true;
  };

  # Bluetooth
  hardware.bluetooth.enable = true; # enables support for Bluetooth
  hardware.bluetooth.powerOnBoot = true; # powers up the default Bluetooth controller on boot

  # Define a user account. Don't forget to set a password with ■passwd■.
  users.users.mycoolusername = {
    isNormalUser = true;
    extraGroups = [“wheel” “networkmanager”];
  };

  # Default shell => ZSH
  programs.zsh.enable = true;
  users.defaultUserShell = pkgs.zsh;

  # Allow Unfree packages
  nixpkgs.config.allowUnfree = true;

  # List packages installed in system profile. To search, run:
  # $ nix search wget
  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
    vim
    wget
    firefox
    chromium
  ];

  system.stateVersion = "24.05"; # Did you read the comment?
}

```

If you're happy with the above, we can move on to the best part, the `flake.nix`.

#### `flake.nix`

Alright, we're nearly at the finish line. The final piece of the (installation) puzzle is to create a `flake.nix` at `/mnt/etc/nixos`, in the same place where you've created the `hardware-configuration.nix` and `configuration.nix`, to bring everything together.

The `flake.nix` is where you'll be able to add additional modules as inputs, such as `home-manager` and `lanzaboote`.

> I'll be honest, Nix flakes are far more versatile/feature-packed than I've let on. I **highly recommend** giving [ryan4yin's](https://github.com/ryan4yin) [NixOS & Flakes Book](https://nixos-and-flakes.thiscute.world/preface)[^nixos-and-flakes-book] a read sometime.

We can define a minimal `flake.nix` like so:

```nix
{
  description = "A minimal flake.nix for a NixOS machine";
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
  }:
  outputs = {self, nixpkgs, ... }@inputs: {
    nixosConfigurations = {
      my-nixos-machine = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
        system = "x86_64-linux"; # Assumes a standard x86 CPU
        modules = [./configuration.nix];
      };
    };
  };
}
```

And with that, we can finally proceed to the very much anticipated install command.

#### `nixos-install`

This is it, moment of truth time. To begin, we’ll change directories to our `nixos` directory:

```sh noLineNumbers
cd /mnt/etc/nixos
```

Then we’ll update our flake. However, because the minimal NixOS install doesn't enable the `nix-command` nor `flakes`, we'll need to append these features as flags to actually perform this step:

```console noLineNumbers
# nix --extra-experimental-features nix-command --extra-experimental-features flakes flake update
```

If that presented no errors, your output should look something like this:

```sh noLineNumbers
[nixos@nixos:/mnt/etc/nixos]$ sudo nix --extra-experimental-features nix-command --extra-experimental-features flakes flake update
warning: creating lock file '/mnt/etc/nixos/flake.lock'

[nixos@nixos:/mnt/etc/nixos]$
```

With a clean `flake update`, that's the go-ahead to perform the magical install command.

```console noLineNumbers
# nixos-install --root /mnt --no-root-passwd --flake /mnt/etc/nixos#nixos
```

Be warned though, this step could take a while (even assuming no compilation errors). As such, now's probably a good time to stretch your legs and get some fresh air. You've probably been sitting here reading this guide for a while now, so, maybe relax your eyes, and go enjoy a refreshment of some kind (a cup of tea, coffee, etc.). That way, if there are any unexpected errors (likely syntax, like a forgotten semi-colon), you'll at least be better prepared to deal with it...

...Alright, if everything did go according to plan you should see output like the following:

```sh noLineNumbers
[nixos@nixos:/mnt/etc/nixos]$ sudo nixos-install --root /mnt --no-root-passwd --flake /mnt/etc/nixos#my-nixos-machine
copying channel...
building the flake in path:/mnt/etc/nixos?lastModified=1729820879@narHash=sha256-xRGYbMOgJiuxxVKLtkxb0yi01srhw/NL652Uq/ghXXY%3D...

Created EFI boot entry "Linux Boot Manager".
Installation finished!

[nixos@nixos:/mnt/etc/nixos]$
```

#### Final Steps

**VERY IMPORTANT:** We still need to setup a password for our user account. We can do that like so:

```console noLineNumbers
# nixos-enter --root /mnt -c “passwd mycoolusername”
```

Once that's all set, it's finally time to reboot. You can do that safely[^installing-nixos-with-flakes-and-lvm-on-luks] like so:

```console noLineNumbers
# umount -R /mnt sudo swapoff -L NIXOS_SWAP sudo vgchange -a n lvmroot sudo cryptsetup close /dev/mapper/cryptroot reboot
```

Or dangerously via a simple: `$ reboot`

If everything went well, you’ll be greeted by LUKS asking for your passphrase.

```sh noLineNumbers

If it went really well, it'll accept your passphrase, and you'll arrive at your Display Manager of choice (or a TTY if that's what you configured), and you'll be able to login to your user with the password you just set.

At this point you can either continue configuring/tweaking your new NixOS machine to your liking before continuing to the next section, or you can just keep pushing through, the choice is up to you.

## Part 02: Secure Boot with Lanzaboote

`Lanzaboote` is a wonderful project that I’ve been happily using on my NixOS machines for about a year now without a single issue. Still yet, it’s always a good idea to back up any important data before setting it up (like, your Windows BitLocker Recovery Keys, in case you're securely dual booting), and especially before updating `Lanzaboote` to the latest release.

In any event, we’ll be following along with the quick start guide [lanzaboote/docs/QUICK_START](https://github.com/nix-community/lanzaboote/blob/master/docs/QUICK_START.md)[^lanzaboote-docs-quick-start] for this section.

**PLEASE BE ADVISED: THE QUICK START GUIDE LINKED ABOVE WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH FAR MORE ACCURATE/CURRENT INSTRUCTIONS THAN WHAT'S SHOWN HERE FOR THIS ARTICLE. THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS ABOUT LANZABOOTE SHOULD BE REGARDED AS SUGGESTIONS/COMMENTARY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY, RATHER THAN AS A TRUE INSTRUCTION MANUAL.**

### Confirm NixOS is installed in UEFI mode

Assuming you met the prerequisites and you successfully installed NixOS into the UEFI, the output of `bootctl status` should look like this:

```sh noLineNumbers
❯ bootctl status
System:
     Firmware: UEFI 2.60 (INSYDE Corp. 22532)
Firmware Arch: x64
  Secure Boot: disabled (disabled)
 TPM2 Support: yes
 Measured UKI: no
 Boot into FW: supported

Current Boot Loader:
      Product: systemd-boot 256.6
...
```

If the firmware is `UEFI` and the current boot loader is `systemd-boot` we can continue.

### Generate the Keys

We’ll need to use `sbctl` for this. You _could_ add it to your system packages like so:

```nix
{pkgs, ...}:
{
  environment.systemPackages = with; pkgs [
    # sbctl needed to generate keys
    sbctl
  ];
}
```

However, we want to just run it from an ephemeral nix shell via `$ nix-shell -p sbctl` (we're going to declare this package in a module, as we'll see).

Either way, once you have `sbctl` just run `# sbctl create-keys` like so:

```sh noLineNumbers
❯ sudo sbctl create-keys
[sudo] password for mycoolusername:
Created Owner UUID fcdc9ade-1757-4fd6-8376-bc21c7f4d093
Creating secure boot keys...✓
Secure boot keys created!
```

### Configure the Lanzaboote Module (Flake)

The following is how I personally like to modularize my own NixOS flake based configuration. What we'll do is amend our minimal flake from earlier, adding `lanzaboote` as an input, and we'll enable it by adding it to our hosts module array. We're also going to create a directory in our `/etc/nixos` folder, called `modules` that will contain a module I'm calling `lanza.nix`. This is what the flake should look like:

```nix {5,6,7,8,10,16,17}
{
  description = "A minimal flake.nix for a SecureBoot-enabled NixOS machine";
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
    lanzaboote = {
      url = "github:nix-community/lanzaboote/v0.4.1";
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
    };
  }:
  outputs = {self, nixpkgs, lanzaboote, ... }@inputs: {
    nixosConfigurations = {
      my-nixos-machine = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
        system = "x86_64-linux"; # Assumes a standard x86 CPU
        modules = [
         ./configuration.nix
         lanzaboote.nixosModules.lanzaboote
         ./modules/lanza.nix
        ];
      };
    };
  };
}
```

Of course, the `./modules/lanza.nix` doesn't exist yet, so let's create it and bring it up in our editor.

```sh noLineNumbers
sudo mkdir /etc/nixos/modules
sudo touch /etc/nixos/modules/lanza.nix
sudo vim /etc/nixos/modules/lanza.nix
```

Then we can create something like this:

```nix
{pkgs, lib, ... }:

{
  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
    # For debugging and troubleshooting Secure Boot.
    sbctl
  ];

  # Lanzaboote currently replaces the systemd-boot module.
  # This setting is usually set to true in configuration.nix
  # generated at installation time. So we force it to false
  # for now.
  boot.loader.systemd-boot.enable = lib.mkForce false;

  boot.lanzaboote = {
    enable = true;
    pkiBundle = "/etc/secureboot";
  };
}
```

> Note: If you previously declared `pkgs.sbctl` in your `configuration.nix`, now might be a good time to remove it from your `configuration.nix` and redeclare it here.

### Enable Lanzaboote

With the module configured, you should be cleared to run `# nixos-rebuild switch`, which will result in `Lanzaboote` being installed/enabled. You can check everything went well with the output from `# sbctl verify`

```sh noLineNumbers
❯ sudo sbctl verify
Verifying file database and EFI images in /boot...
✓ /boot/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI is signed
✓ /boot/EFI/Linux/nixos-generation-1.efi is signed
✓ /boot/EFI/Linux/nixos-generation-2.efi is signed
✗ /boot/EFI/nixos/kernel-linux-6.11.5.efi is not signed
✓ /boot/EFI/systemd/systemd-bootx64.efi is signed
```

If the output looks clean, we can enable secure boot.

> _"It is expected that the files ending with `bzImage.efi` are **not** signed."_ - _The QUICK_START guide for Lanzaboote_

### Enabling Secure Boot

if you followed the beginning of this guide, secure boot is currently disabled. What we’re going to do now is turn it back on, but with _setup mode_ enabled.

#### Enable Setup Mode

My Lenovo laptop has this _setup mode_, and if you happen to have it as well, simply turn it on and proceed to the next step.

> Note: on my Lenovo laptop, when I enable setup mode, it disables secure boot simultaneously. So, make sure to re-enable it either before you leave the UEFI/BIOS, or after enrolling the keys.

However, if you, like me, also happen to have a machine with an ASUS motherboard, then we’ll have to take some extra steps.

1. Enable secure boot
2. Install factory default keys (if they’re empty)
3. Delete every key **except the Forbidden Signature Database (dbx)**
4. This is typically the key at the bottom of the list
5. Save changes and reboot

### Enroll the Keys

Now that secure boot’s enabled (sorta), we can enroll the keys we generated earlier with vendor keys from Microsoft.

```sh noLineNumbers
$ sudo sbctl enroll-keys --microsoft
[sudo] password for lani:
Enrolling keys to EFI variables...
With vendor keys from microsoft...✓
Enrolled keys to the EFI variables!
```

And now, just reboot! Once you’re back in, you can verify secure boot is activated (user mode).

```sh noLineNumbers
$ bootctl status
System:
      Firmware: UEFI 2.60 (INSYDE Corp. 225332)
 Firmware Arch: x64
   Secure Boot: enabled (user)
  TPM2 Support: yes
  Measured UKI: yes
  Boot into FW: supported
```

## Part 2.5: Unlocking LUKS with the TPM using `systemd-cryptenroll`

At the very beginning of this guide, I promised I’d show you how to auto decrypt your LUKS device with TPM2. So, to do that, we’re going to amend the `lanza.nix` module we created earlier, to both install `tpm2-tss` and to create a tiny script (`luks-helper`) to leverage a handy tool included in systemd,`systemd-cryptenroll`. The command our script calls on our LUKS device (NIXLUKS) looks something like this:

```console noLineNumbers
# systemd-cryptenroll --wipe-slot=tpm2 --tpm2-device=auto --tpm2-pcrs=0+7 /dev/disk/by-label/NIXLUKS
```

The flags on the command do the following:

- `--wipe-slot=tpm2` clears out any previous keys bound to the slot.
- `--tpm2-device=auto` automatically grabs the default TPM2 chip (found on your motherboard)
- `--tpm2-pcrs=0+7` can be useful when binding multiple keys/devices. It separates the Platform Configuration Registers the keys bind to by 7 (default).

```nix
{pkgs, lib, ... }:
let
  luksCryptenroller = pkgs.writeTextFile {
    name = "luksCryptenroller";
    destination = "/bin/luksCryptenroller";
    executable = true;

    # Note: You can hardcode additional LUKS devices like so:
    # text = let
    #   ...
    #   luksDevice02 = "BEEGLUKS01";
    #   luksDevice03 = "BEEGLUKS02";
    # in ''
    #   ...
    #   sudo systemd-cryptenroll --wipe-slot=tpm2 --tpm2-device=auto --tpm2-pcrs=0+7 /dev/disk/by-label/${luksDevice02}
    #   sudo systemd-cryptenroll --wipe-slot=tpm2 --tpm2-device=auto --tpm2-pcrs=0+7 /dev/disk/by-label/${luksDevice03}
    # '';

    text = let
      luksDevice01 = "NIXLUKS";
    in ''
      sudo systemd-cryptenroll --wipe-slot=tpm2 --tpm2-device=auto --tpm2-pcrs=0+7 /dev/disk/by-label/${luksDevice01}
    '';
  };
in
{
  environment.systemPackages = with [
    luksCryptenroller
    # For debugging and troubleshooting Secure Boot.
    pkgs.sbctl
    # For `systemd-cryptenroll`
    pkgs.tpm2-tss
  ];

  # Lanzaboote currently replaces the systemd-boot module.
  # This setting is usually set to true in configuration.nix
  # generated at installation time. So we force it to false
  # for now.
  boot.loader.systemd-boot.enable = lib.mkForce false;

  boot.lanzaboote = {
    enable = true;
    pkiBundle = "/etc/secureboot";
  };
}
```

I'll admit, not the prettiest (or the DRYest) `bash` script in the world, but _hey_, it gets the job done. A far more _sophisticated_ approach would probably store the LUKS devices in an array, and use a for loop to run through it, calling `systemd-cryptenroll` with the current/_ith_ device in the array. I'll leave that up to you to implement.

### Enrolling the keys

This is rather straight forward just run `$ luksCryptenroller` (you'll immediately be prompted for your `superuser` password). Then just enter your passphrase for each LUKS device, in the order you declared them in.

> Fun fact, if all your LUKS devices share the same passphrase, `systemd-cryptenroll` seems to just know to re-use it, rather than prompting you for it again. As to how that's possible ... well I have no idea. Perhaps `systemd-cryptenroll` stores the passphrase temporarily in memory, and makes a call to check if it still exists/validates on every enrollment, and if it does, uses it until it comes across a device the stored passphrase doesn't decrypt. That's just a best guess though, it's also entirely possible this _feature_ isn't purposeful, and might actually be a bug.

## Part 03: Configuring Home Manager (Abridged)

`home-manager` is a very extensive utility for configuring the user (rather than the global/system) environment on a Nix/NixOS machine. It's far too much to talk about in detail here, so I'll leave you with the official [Home Manager Manual](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/)[^home-manager-manual], a very handy tool: [Home Manager Option Search](https://home-manager-options.extranix.com/)[^home-manager---option-search], and finally the [nix-community/home-manager/issues](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/issues)[^issues---nix-community-home-manager] page for when things go awry (It doesn't happen that often, but I'll admit weird bugs do happen on occasion).

As such, I'm going to very briefly walk you through configuring `home-manager` via further amending our `flake.nix`, and setting up the most important features I use it for (shell configuration, `git`/`gh` configuration, etc.).

### Step 0 - `fonts.nix`

Shells look best with monospaced fonts, especially _monospaced nerd-fonts_, so before we get ahead of ourselves, let's create a `fonts.nix` in the systemwide space.

```console noLineNumbers
# touch /etc/nixos/modules/fonts.nix
```

And we'll bring it into an editor with:

```console noLineNumbers
# vim /etc/nixos/modules/fonts.nix
```

To create the following:

```nix
# modules/fonts.nix
{pkgs, ...}:
{
  fonts = {
    fontconfig = {
      enable = true;
    };
    packages = with pkgs; [
      noto-fonts
      noto-fonts-emoji-blob-bin
      noto-fonts-cjk-sans
      nerd-fonts._0xproto # personal fav monospaced font. However, you can use whatever monospaced nerd font you'd like.
      nerd-fonts.symbols-only
    ];
  };
}
```

As you'll notice, this module enables a system wide `fontconfig` (we'll use home-manager to enable the user space one), and several common font packages, along with my favorite monospaced font (0xProto) packaged as a nerd-font.

We can then import it into `configuration.nix` like so:

```nix
# configuration.nix
{ config, lib, pkgs, ... }:

{
  imports =
    [ # Include the results of the hardware scan.
      ./hardware-configuration.nix
      ./modules/fonts.nix
    ];

  ...
}
```

We can then build the new configuration like so:

```console noLineNumbers
# nixos-rebuild switch
```

And with single `# nixos-rebuild switch` we now have all the fonts we need to continue.

### Configuring Home Manager via `flake.nix`

This is rather straight forward (it's one of the neat things about flakes!), just like we added `lanzaboote`, we'll add `home-manager` as an input, and configure it as a module[^home-manager-manual-flakes-nixos-module].

```nix {9,10,11,12,14,18,19,20,25,26,27,28,29,30,31}
{
  description = "A minimal flake.nix for a SecureBoot-enabled NixOS machine, with Home Manager";
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
    lanzaboote = {
      url = "github:nix-community/lanzaboote/v0.4.1";
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
    };
    home-manager = {
      url = "github:nix-community/home-manager";
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
    };
  }:
  outputs = {self, nixpkgs, lanzaboote, home-manager, ... }@inputs: {
    nixosConfigurations = {
      my-nixos-machine = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
        system = "x86_64-linux"; # Assumes a standard x86 CPU
        specialArgs = {
          inherit inputs; # this passes down the inputs
        };
        modules = [
          ./configuration.nix
          lanzaboote.nixosModules.lanzaboote
          ./modules/lanza.nix
          home-manager.nixosModules.home-manager
          {
            home-manager.useGlobalPkgs = true;
            home-manager.useUserPackages = true;
            home-manager.users.mycoolusername = import ./home;
            home-manager.extraSpecialArgs = inputs; # from the passed down input, we can pass these as args to `home.nix`
          }
        ];
      };
    };
  };
}
```

Then we'll create our `home` directory, along with the module's we'll need:

```sh noLineNumbers
❯ sudo mkdir /etc/nixos/home
❯ sudo mkdir /etc/nixos/home/modules
❯ sudo mkdir /etc/nixos/home/modules/shell
❯ sudo touch /etc/nixos/home/default.nix
❯ sudo touch /etc/nixos/home/home-configuration.nix
❯ sudo touch /etc/nixos/home/modules/shell/default.nix
❯ sudo touch /etc/nixos/home/modules/shell/zsh.nix
❯ sudo touch /etc/nixos/home/modules/shell/starship.nix
❯ sudo touch /etc/nixos/home/modules/shell/git-gh.nix
```

The above is pretty verbose, so let's walk through each module.

#### Quick Aside: `default.nix`

You probably noticed in our flake config this line:

```nix
{
   home-manager.users.mycoolusername = import ./home;
}
```

As well as the two `default.nix` modules we created in `./home` and `./home/modules/shell`. So, what does it do? Well, it's a module that primarily serves to imports other modules. As an added bonus, the way to import a `default.nix` module, is through referencing it's parent directory, such as `home` or `home/modules/shell`.

This is a feature that becomes more useful, when you have modules that shouldn't be imported by default. For example, you might decide to create modules for AMD GPUs (`modules/amd.nix`) and Nvidia GPUs (`modules/nvidia.nix`). Unless you want to install both sets of drivers across all your machines, you'll probably want to manually import those on a system by system basis via the flake.nix, rather than importing both via a `default.nix` in a `modules/gpu` directory.

#### `home/default.nix`

Continuing, let's start with `home/default.nix`. Using a `superuser` privileged editor, you'll want to assemble `home/default.nix` like this:

```nix
{
  imports = [
    ./home-configuration.nix
    ./modules/shell
  ];
}
```

Inline with the spirit of `default.nix`, this simply imports a file called `./home-configuration.nix` (which we'll configure next), and another `default.nix` which declares the default imports for the `shell` module.

#### `home/home-configuration.nix`

And we can assemble `home-configuration.nix` like so:

```nix
{
  home.username = "mycoolusername";
  home.homeDirectory = "/home/mycoolusername";
  home.stateVersion = "24.05";
  programs.home-manager.enable = true;
}
```

The above configures Home Manager to act on `mycoolusername`'s home directory, and enables itself.

#### `home/modules/shell/default.nix`

Another `default.nix` module, it'll import modules used primarily within the terminal shell.

```nix
{
  imports = [
    ./zsh.nix
    ./starship.nix
    ./git-gh.nix
  ];
}
```

#### `home/modules/shell/zsh.nix`

```nix
{config, ...}: {
  home.packages = with pkgs; [
    pfetch-rs
  ];

  programs.zsh = {
    enable = true;
    autosuggestion.enable = true;
    syntaxHighlighting.enable = true;
    history = {
      size = 10000;
      path = "${config.xdg.dataHome}/zsh/history";
    };
    initExtra = ''
    case $(tty) in
      (/dev/tty[1-9]);;
      (*)
        eval pfetch;;
    esac
    '';
  };
}
```

The above configures `zsh` (which we declared and enabled as the default shell from `configuration.nix`), with some common plugins, a decent history size, and even runs `pfetch` every time you open a fresh shell. The little if/case statement in `initExtra` ensures `pfetch` doesn't run in a bare `tty` (which, I'm sure you're very familiar with if you followed [Part 01: From Zero to NixOS](#part-01-from-zero-to-nixos) all the way through).

#### `home/modules/shell/starship.nix`

```nix
{
  programs.starship = {
    enable = true;
    settings = {
      add_newline = false;

      nix_shell = {
        symbol = " ";
      };

      git_status = {
        format = "([\$all_status$ahead_behind\]($style) )";
        modified = "󰇂 ";
        ahead = " $\{count}";
        conflicted = "󱚝 ";
        behind = " $\{count}";
        diverged = "󰹺   $\{ahead_count}  $\{behind_count}";
        up_to_date = " ";
        deleted = "󰮉 ";
        untracked = "󱚠 ";
        stashed = " ";
        staged = " ";
        style = "bold blue";
      };
    };
  };
}
```

The above is my personal Starship Prompt configuration, and I hope it serves you well in your version control adventures (if you choose to implement this module).

#### `home/modules/shell/git-gh.nix`

```nix
{
  programs.git = {
    enable = true;
    userName = "mycoolgithubusername";
    userEmail = "mycoolgithubacctemail@xample.com";
    extraConfig = {
      safe.directory = "/etc/nixos";
      core.editor = "nvim"; # We didn't cover this, but I trust you can setup neovim on your own, perhaps via nixvim ;3 (https://nix-community.github.io/nixvim/)
    };
  };
  programs.gh = {
    enable = true;
  };
}
```

#### Finishing Touches

With all the modules configured, it's time to run `# nixos-rebuild switch` and bask in the triumph of having accomplished a LOT today, with a base Home Manager configuration as the cherry on top.

## Discussion

Welcome to the end of a very long ~~blog post~~ _guide_. If you completed the above, you have earned a very well deserved break and celebration of your accomplishments today (or however long it took to get through this guide).

What you've done is no small feat. In reaching the end of this guide, you've installed NixOS with Full Disk Encryption, enabled secure boot with `lanzaboote`, enabled auto decryption of your LUKS devices with `systemd-cryptenroller`, and finally configured a slick `zsh` shell with Starship Prompt, some plugins, and configured `git` and `gh`, ready to turn your `/etc/nixos` folder into a repo[^other-useful-tips]. If you knew nothing about Nix when you first got here, well, I hope you were able to get the gist of it after reaching the end here, and picked up a few things along the way.

I also hope that in being your guide on this journey through the major circles of Nix, that you were able to overcome some of the steep learning curve Nix/NixOS is infamously known for. If however, I failed to help with that, well, I guess I'll just have to update this post in accordance to your feedback.

In any event, I hope you learned something, and if you were ever a chronic distrohopper[^distrohopper] like I was, I hope NixOS brings you the same peace of mind it brought me, serving as the final distro following a very long series of hops.

> Final note: Eventually, you'll want to clean out old _Nix generations_ (created after each `# nixos-rebuild switch`) since they can really start piling up, monopolozing diskspace. You can do so (mildly dangerously) with `# nix-collect-garbage -d` to delete _all_ old generations of profiles. Or, for a much safer garbage collection, you can run `# nix-collect-garbage --delete-older-than <time_period>` to remove things older than, say, 30 days, using `30d` as the time period. [^nix-collect-garbage].
>
> The former garbage collection command can also become **_très dangereaux_**, if your last config and current config are both broken in a way that you can no longer access the `TTY`, since all possible escape hatches (working generations) would be removed. This is probably one of the only ways you can truly _brick_ a NixOS install.
